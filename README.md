**[NetflixGPT](https://github.com/Pradeep784/netflix-gpt)**

Tech Stack: React.js, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, TMDB API, Gemini AI

NetflixGPT is an AI-powered movie recommendation platform that uses Gemini AI to suggest personalized movies. Built with React.js for a seamless front-end experience, it fetches real-time data using the TMDB API. User authentication is handled via Firebase, ensuring secure sign-ins. The responsive interface was designed using Tailwind CSS for a modern, clean look. Users receive tailored suggestions based on their preferences, making it easy to discover new movies.
